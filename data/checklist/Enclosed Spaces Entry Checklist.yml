    "1. In order to obtain a representative cross- section of the space's atmosphere, samples should be taken from several levels and through as many openings as possible. Ventilation should be stopped for about 10 minutes before the pre-entry atmosphere tests are taken.
    2. Tests for specific toxic contaminants, such as benzene or hydrogen sulphide, must be undertaken depending on the nature of the previous contents of the space.Refer to the MSDS of the previous contents of the space and test for specific toxic gas.
    3. Prior entry, the toxic gas concentration should not be more than 50% OEL(Occupational Exposure Limit).The term OEL includes Permissible Exposure Limit(PEL), Maximum Admissible Concentration(MAC) and Threshold Limit Value(TLV)
    4. Individual checklist is to be made for each space to be entered.",
