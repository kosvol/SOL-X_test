    "1. This checklist relates to any work involving temperature conditions, which are likely to be of sufficient intensity to cause ignition of combustible gases, vapor or liquids in, or adjacent to the area involved.\n2. Tests for combustible gas should be carried out immediately before commencement of hot work and at frequent intervals as long as the work is in progress.",
    "Section 1 is to be completed at all times and Section 2 to be completed if applicable.",
    "DEVIATION\nThe condition under which the operation takes place may change during the process. The changes may be such that safety can no longer be regarded as guaranteed.
